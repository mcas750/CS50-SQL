# From the Deep

In this problem, you'll write freeform responses to the questions provided in the specification.

## Random Partitioning

Random partitioning makes it easier to accumulate large amounts of data because it restores data volume and allows for better scaling. However, this complicates and slows down the acquisition of initial data, since a search is required across all boats.

## Partitioning by Hour

In this approach, the distribution of data will be uneven. This will make it easier to further obtain the necessary information, but some boats may be overloaded with information.

## Partitioning by Hash Value

Using hash values ​​will prevent the ship from being overloaded with a large amount of data and will reduce the time spent searching for information. To speed up your search, you can use indexes. However, careful design and implementation of hash functions is required.
